# Connector package specification

This document is the author-facing contract for local declarative connector
packages. The accepted specification identifiers are the frozen
`duckdb_api/v1` family, the additive `duckdb_api/v2` family, and the reactive
rate-limit-capable `duckdb_api/v3` family.
[RFC 0013](rfcs/0013-define-connector-package-v1-contract.md) accepted v1;
[RFC 0024](rfcs/0024-enable-bounded-replay-safe-retry.md) accepted v2 solely
to add an explicit bounded safe-read retry recommendation; and
[RFC 0025](rfcs/0025-enable-bounded-reactive-rate-limit-handling.md) accepted
v3 to add explicit bounded reaction to declared remote quota responses. The
schemas below close every source shape.

The specification describes immutable metadata. It does not grant network or
credential authority by itself, and it does not contain DuckDB catalog state,
scan plans, residual filters, execution state, or secret values.

## Package layout and identity

A package root is an explicit absolute local directory:

```text
connector.yaml
relations/<relation_id>.yaml
fixtures/index.yaml
fixtures/...
README.md
```

`connector.yaml` lists relation identifiers in order. Each identifier resolves
only to `relations/<relation_id>.yaml`; inline relations and arbitrary relation
paths are not valid. Ordinary load reads only the manifest and listed relation
files. Fixture tooling separately opens `fixtures/`. `README.md` is human
documentation and is not semantic source.

Four identities remain distinct:

| Identity | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Specification | Exact matching `duckdb_api/v1`, `duckdb_api/v2`, or `duckdb_api/v3` in every machine-readable source file |
| Project | The extension release version |
| Package | Canonical author SemVer `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` in `connector.yaml` |
| Generation | Specification, connector ID, package version, and package digest |

Package version components are unsigned 32-bit canonical decimals. Signs,
leading zeroes, omitted components, prerelease labels, and build metadata are
invalid.

The package digest is
`sha256-length-prefixed-path-and-bytes-v1` over `connector.yaml` and exactly the
listed relation files. Paths are normalized UTF-8 POSIX relative paths and
sorted bytewise. For each file, the digest receives:

```text
u64be(path length) || path bytes || u64be(content length) || raw content
```

The public spelling is `sha256.<64 lowercase hexadecimal digits>`. Absolute
root, file metadata, fixtures, README, and unreferenced files do not enter the
digest. Any semantic-source byte change does.

## Source custody and YAML

The loader does not expand tildes, environment variables, URLs, or search
paths. It opens every absolute root component and admitted child without
following links. Symbolic links, hard-linked leaves, special files, `.` or
`..`, backslashes, absolute child paths, duplicate normalized paths,
case-colliding paths, unlisted relation YAML, and files that change during the
read are rejected.

Compilation operates on one bounded immutable byte snapshot. The loader
captures and compares root and `relations` entry sets plus file device, inode,
type, link count, size, modification time, and change time before and after
the read. It never compiles a mixture of filesystem states.

Each YAML source is one UTF-8 YAML 1.2 document under the failsafe schema. All
scalars initially decode as text; field-role validation interprets Booleans,
integers, identifiers, enums, and typed values afterward.

Accepted syntax:

- block mappings and sequences;
- flow mappings and sequences;
- plain scalars; and
- double-quoted scalars with JSON string escapes.

Rejected syntax includes UTF-8 BOM, CR line endings, indentation tabs, explicit
tags, single-quoted or block scalars, anchors, aliases, merge keys, duplicate
mapping keys, and multiple documents. The plain token `null` is text and is
valid only as the documented null-value discriminator. `~` has no valid role.
Boolean fields accept only plain `true` or `false`; integer fields accept only
their documented canonical decimal grammar.

The exact decoded source schemas are:

- [`connector-package-v1.schema.json`](rfcs/evidence/0013/connector-package-v1.schema.json)
- [`connector-package-v2.schema.json`](../src/connector/package/assets/connector-package-v2.schema.json)
- [`connector-package-v3.schema.json`](../src/connector/package/assets/connector-package-v3.schema.json)
- [`fixture-index-v1.schema.json`](rfcs/evidence/0013/fixture-index-v1.schema.json)

Unknown fields fail. Schema validation is followed by identifier, reference,
type, uniqueness, selector, policy, resource, predicate, and protocol laws.

## Manifest

The manifest has this closed top-level shape:

```yaml
api_version: duckdb_api/v1
kind: connector
id: github
version: 1.0.0
extractor_dialect: duckdb_api/json_path_v1

credentials: []
network_policy: {}
relations: []
```

Connector, relation, column, input, operation, predicate, and credential IDs
use lower-case snake case, begin with a lower-case ASCII letter, and contain at
most 63 bytes. IDs are case-sensitive source identities. Generated DuckDB
names follow DuckDB's case-insensitive catalog comparison.

`extractor_dialect` is exactly `duckdb_api/json_path_v1`. The accepted JSON
path subset is structural and deterministic: root `$`, dot-name object fields,
and the terminal collection marker `[*]` where a response declaration permits
it. Recursive descent, filters, scripts, unions, slices, wildcards in column
extractors, and implementation-specific coercions are invalid.

### Credentials

V1 admits two static credential kinds: bearer and api_key. Both resolve
their value from exactly one named DuckDB secret at execution; neither
supports token acquisition, refresh, expiry, or any other dynamic behavior.

Bearer places the resolved value in the fixed `Authorization` header:

```yaml
credentials:
  - id: github_token
    kind: bearer
    secret_field: token
    placement: authorization_header
    destinations:
      - scheme: https
        host: api.github.com
        port: 443
```

**Accepted by [RFC 0018](rfcs/0018-add-static-api-key-credential.md).**
API-key credentials place the resolved value as an author-declared fixed
HTTP header or URL query parameter instead of `Authorization`:

```yaml
credentials:
  - id: service_api_key_header
    kind: api_key
    secret_field: token
    placement: header
    header_name: X-Api-Key
    destinations:
      - scheme: https
        host: api.example.com
        port: 443
  - id: service_api_key_query
    kind: api_key
    secret_field: token
    placement: query
    query_param: api_key
    destinations:
      - scheme: https
        host: api.example.com
        port: 443
```

`header_name` is required and validated exactly when `placement: header`;
`query_param` is required and validated exactly when `placement: query`;
each is rejected as an unknown field for the other placement and for
`kind: bearer`. A declared `header_name` or `query_param` that collides with
another declared field on the same operation (a fixed header, or a fixed,
input-bound, or conditional query field) is rejected — the credential value
can never silently shadow or be shadowed by another declared field.

`secret_field` is a logical field name, not a DuckDB secret name or a secret
value. The runtime materializes an approved credential capability only
during execution and only for an exact declared destination. The credential
value never enters package source, compiled explanation, `ScanPlan`,
diagnostics, fixtures, digests, or catalog introspection for either kind;
`EXPLAIN` renders the credential kind and the declared placement name (e.g.
`authenticator:api_key,placement:header:X-Api-Key`) but never the value.

The package does not choose the DuckDB credential provider or storage.
Operators bind the logical relation argument to an explicitly created
`duckdb_api` credential. The closed SQL surface admits `config(TOKEN ...)` and
`environment(VARIABLE ...)`, each in temporary `memory` or persistent
`duckdb_api` storage. Runtime resolves one immutable snapshot after plan
admission; provider choice, storage, authority identity, and revision never
become package syntax or request-policy facts.

### Network policy

Every manifest declares a deny-only network policy:

```yaml
network_policy:
  origins:
    - scheme: https
      host: api.github.com
      port: 443
  redirects: deny
  private_addresses: deny
  link_local_addresses: deny
  loopback_addresses: deny
  max_response_bytes: 8388608
```

Only HTTPS origins are accepted. Connector policy may narrow host policy but
never widen it. Redirects and private, link-local, and loopback addresses are
always denied in v1. Hosts are exact lower-case DNS names or admitted IP
literals; URL userinfo, wildcard hosts, path prefixes, and ambient proxy,
cookie, netrc, or credential policy are not authorable.

## Relations and structural types

Each `relations/<id>.yaml` begins:

```yaml
api_version: duckdb_api/v1
kind: relation
id: authenticated_repositories
schema: static
```

`schema` is exactly `static`. Scalar column types are `BOOLEAN`, `BIGINT`,
`VARCHAR`, and `DOUBLE`. A column may instead declare `type: ARRAY` with one
required scalar `element_type` from that same set and an explicit required
`element_nullable` Boolean. Columns retain declaration order:

```yaml
columns:
  - id: private
    type: BOOLEAN
    nullable: false
    extract: $.private
  - id: tags
    type: ARRAY
    element_type: VARCHAR
    element_nullable: false
    nullable: true
    extract: $.tags
```

Conversion is strict. Missing or JSON-null data fails for a non-nullable
column. For an array column, a present value must be a JSON array; each child
must match `element_type`, and a JSON-null child is accepted only when
`element_nullable: true`. An empty array is a valid non-NULL value. Child
order and duplicates are preserved. Arrays are flat: `element_type: ARRAY`,
nested arrays, and object children are rejected. Numeric conversion must be
integral and lossless for `BIGINT`; strings
and Booleans are never coerced across types. `DOUBLE` accepts any JSON number
(a fractional part and exponent are both permitted, unlike `BIGINT`) and
decodes to the nearest IEEE-754 double; a magnitude too large to represent as
any finite double is rejected, while underflow to a subnormal or exact zero is
a legitimate decoded result, not an error.

### Relation inputs and defaults

Relation inputs are ordered named DuckDB arguments:

```yaml
inputs:
  - id: owner
    type: VARCHAR
    nullable: false
  - id: include_archived
    type: BOOLEAN
    nullable: true
    default:
      kind: boolean
      value: false
```

Defaults use a discriminated object. The admitted `kind` values correspond to
the declared type plus `null` for a nullable typed NULL default. Boolean
defaults use plain `true` or `false`; `BIGINT` defaults use canonical signed
64-bit decimal; `VARCHAR` defaults use a double-quoted scalar; `DOUBLE`
defaults use a plain JSON-number-shaped literal under the same conversion
rule as a column value. A default's type must exactly match its input. A
non-nullable input cannot default to NULL.

`secret` is reserved and cannot be a relation input. Query synthesizes a
separate required `secret VARCHAR` argument only for an authenticated
relation.

All relation inputs are omittable at DuckDB bind. Semantics distinguishes:

- `UNBOUND`: no explicit argument;
- `BOUND_NULL`: explicit SQL NULL; and
- `BOUND_VALUE`: explicit typed value.

A default applies only to `UNBOUND`. Explicit NULL suppresses a default and is
invalid for a non-nullable input. Only `BOUND_VALUE` satisfies a required-input
operation selector.

### Authentication

A relation is anonymous:

```yaml
auth:
  mode: anonymous
```

or references one manifest credential declaration (bearer or api_key):

```yaml
auth:
  mode: credential
  credential: github_token
```

The operation origin must be within both the credential destination set and
the connector network policy. Packages never name a DuckDB secret or carry a
credential value.

### Resource envelope

Every relation declares positive ceilings:

```yaml
resources:
  max_response_bytes_per_page: 8388608
  max_response_bytes_per_scan: 67108864
  max_records_per_page: 100
  max_records_per_scan: 3200
  max_extracted_string_bytes: 512
```

All resource values are canonical unsigned 64-bit decimals in
`1..18446744073709551615`. The compiler uses checked arithmetic and rejects
contradictory or overflowing page/scan envelopes. Runtime intersects these
values with host ceilings and debits actual use.

## Operation selection

A relation declares one or more base operations. V1 selectors contain only:

- `when.required_inputs`, containing tagged `input.<id>` or
  `conditional.<id>` references; and
- at most one relation-wide `fallback: true` operation.

For each non-fallback candidate, Semantics resolves relation inputs and typed
defaults, derives only that operation's predicate-owned conditional inputs,
and checks required references. Eligible operations rank by the number of
satisfied required references. Equal top ranks fail; declaration order never
breaks a tie. The fallback is considered only when no non-fallback is eligible.

Alternative input sets, forbidden-input selectors, author priority, and
declaration-order precedence are not part of `duckdb_api/v1`.

## V2 bounded retry recommendation

`duckdb_api/v2` retains the complete v1 grammar and permits one additional
operation field only for a compiled `replayable_read`:

```yaml
retry:
  max_attempts_per_step: 3
  max_delay_milliseconds: 100
  max_cumulative_waiting_milliseconds_per_scan: 250
```

All three fields are required. Attempts are `2..3`, one delay is `1..100`
milliseconds, and aggregate scan waiting is `1..250` milliseconds. Partial or
unknown fields, unsafe/unknown replay semantics, writes, and idempotency-key
profiles fail compilation. Absence means one attempt and zero retry waiting.
V1 rejects `retry` as an unknown field and retains byte-for-byte one-attempt
behavior. Moving to v2 or changing a retry block requires a package-major
version because it changes request amplification and failure behavior.

## V3 bounded reactive rate-limit policy

`duckdb_api/v3` retains the complete v2 grammar and permits a replayable read
to declare one optional `rate_limit` block:

```yaml
rate_limit:
  statuses: [429]
  mode: wait_if_deadline_allows
  operation_family: core_requests
  principal_scope: credential_authority
  guidance:
    - header: retry-after
      format: retry_after
    - header: x-ratelimit-reset
      format: unix_seconds
  remaining:
    header: x-ratelimit-remaining
  remote_bucket:
    header: x-ratelimit-resource
  max_attempts_per_step: 3
  max_delay_milliseconds: 30000
  max_cumulative_waiting_milliseconds_per_scan: 30000
```

Presence requires `statuses`, `mode`, `operation_family`, and
`principal_scope`; no field has an implicit default. Statuses are one through
eight unique exact three-digit decimals in `400..599`, excluding `401`, `403`,
and `407`. Mode is `fail`, `wait`, or `wait_if_deadline_allows`.
`operation_family` matches `[a-z][a-z0-9_]{0,63}`. Principal scope is exactly
`credential_authority` or `shared`; only the latter is source-visible consent
for different credential authorities to share one local quota key.

Declared field names are unique across roles, 1 through 64 bytes, lower-case
HTTP tokens; `date` is reserved. Guidance contains one through four unique
fields whose formats are `retry_after`, `delta_seconds`, or `unix_seconds`.
Optional `remaining` and `remote_bucket` blocks each contain only `header`.
Header names are immutable structural facts; response values are never
compiled, planned, explained, or retained as fixture identities.

Waiting modes require guidance and all three maxima. Attempts are `2..3`; the
one-delay and aggregate rate-limit-wait maxima are each `1..30000`
milliseconds. `fail` forbids guidance, remaining, remote bucket, and maxima
and always terminates a complete matching response as `policy_fail` without
parsing fields. The block is rejected for any operation other than a proved
`replayable_read`. V1 and v2 reject it.

Changing from v1 or v2 to v3 requires a package-major version even when the
block is absent. Adding, removing, or changing the block within v3 also
requires a package-major version: it can change requests, latency, failure
behavior, and the local coordination identity.

## REST operations

REST v1 admits replay-safe HTTPS `GET` with a fixed origin and path:

```yaml
operations:
  - id: list_rows
    fallback: true
    cardinality: many
    replay_safety: safe
    request:
      protocol: rest
      method: GET
      origin:
        scheme: https
        host: api.github.com
        port: 443
      path: /rows
      query: []
      headers: []
    response:
      source: root_array
    pagination:
      strategy: disabled
```

`cardinality` is `one` or `many`. `one` requires a root object response;
`many` accepts `root_array` or `terminal_collection` with a records path.

Ordered query fields contain exactly one value source:

- a fixed non-sensitive UTF-8 literal;
- a declared relation `input`; or
- one selected operation-local `conditional` predicate input.

Every query value uses `form_urlencoded`. Relation-input fields require
`omit_when_unbound: true` and `omit_when_null: true`; v1 has no emit-null
encoding. Fixed headers are non-sensitive structural values. `Authorization`,
`Proxy-Authorization`, `Cookie`, and other credential-bearing placements are
not fixed author metadata.

Pagination is `disabled`, sequential mutable `Link: rel=next` (`link_next`),
a body-embedded next-page URL (`response_next`), or count-terminated with no
continuation signal at all (`short_page`). An accepted continuation must
remain on the exact operation origin and path. Pagination is pull-driven, one
page at a time, bounded by positive page and scan ceilings, and does not
grant ordering, snapshot, parallelism, resume, deduplication, or cache
guarantees. Automatic retry occurs only for an explicitly opted-in v2 safe
read and remains page-atomic and bounded by the Runtime contract.

The REST pagination strategy set is closed at `{disabled, link_next,
response_next, short_page}`. Common real-world shapes outside this set are
rejected by the closed schema rather than silently reinterpreted: an opaque
body-embedded cursor that drives the next request directly rather than being
verified against a locally reconstructed expectation, and reverse or
bidirectional traversal. GraphQL REST-like body pagination is likewise
outside the structured GraphQL profile below. A later accepted contract and
pre-freeze evidence would be required to admit any such strategy; the
compiler rejects the declaration today (verified as
`DUCKDB_API_UNSUPPORTED_DECLARATION` in the schema phase).

`response_next` (accepted by [RFC 0016](rfcs/0016-decide-body-signaled-rest-pagination.md),
shipped in `0.10.0`) is architecturally identical to `link_next` except the
continuation signal is read from a required `next_url_path` JSON path field
(under the `json_path_v1` extractor grammar) rather than an HTTP `Link`
header, reusing the exact reconstruct-and-verify target-validation rule.

`short_page` (accepted and shipped by [RFC 0019](rfcs/0019-add-short-page-pagination.md))
reuses the identical `page_size_parameter`/`page_size`/`page_number_parameter`/
`first_page`/`page_increment`/`max_pages_per_scan` fields `link_next` already
requires, with one difference: `page_size_parameter`/`page_size` are
**required**, not optional, since termination depends on comparing the
just-decoded page's row count against a known page size. Unlike
`link_next`/`response_next`, there is no external continuation signal to
validate at all — a page with fewer rows than the declared page size (or an
empty page) exhausts the scan; `max_pages_per_scan` remains the hard backstop
if a server never returns a short page. This covers plain `?page=N&page_size=M`
or `?offset=N&limit=M` REST APIs that signal exhaustion only by page size,
without a `Link` header or a body-embedded next-page URL.

The broader exclusion covering an opaque body-embedded cursor used directly
to build the next request (a materially different, less conservative trust
flow than every accepted strategy's reconstruct-and-verify model — see RFC
0016's and RFC 0019's Alternatives sections) and reverse or bidirectional
traversal remains permanent; admitting either still requires its own later
accepted RFC.

## Structured GraphQL operations

GraphQL authoring is structured; raw documents are not accepted. A query
declares:

- one query operation name;
- a root field path;
- typed fixed arguments made from Boolean, signed 64-bit integer, string,
  enum, null, list, and ordered object literals;
- one output selection per declared relation column; and
- the closed forward Relay pagination profile.

The compiler validates GraphQL names, aliases, response-path ownership,
duplicate arguments/object fields, scalar-or-list compatibility, and disjoint row,
error, and page-info paths. It generates one canonical query-only document and
parses that generated document as a backstop. Mutation, subscription,
introspection, caller-supplied documents, fragments, directives, arbitrary
variables, partial-data recovery, and reverse pagination are invalid.

Generated GraphQL supports scalar results and flat `ARRAY` results whose
elements are `BOOLEAN`, `BIGINT`, or `VARCHAR`. `ARRAY<DOUBLE>` remains
rejected because this GraphQL profile has no declared floating-point scalar.

Relay pagination is sequential and mutable with exact names for page size,
cursor, `pageInfo`, `hasNextPage`, and `endCursor`; `max_concurrent_pages` is
exactly 1. `partial_data` is exactly `fail_on_any_error`. Positive document,
request-body, page, record, and scan limits are mandatory.

The repository package contains complete REST and GraphQL examples under
[`connectors/github`](../connectors/github).

## Predicate mappings and DuckDB ownership

V1 predicate declarations map one positive typed equality to at most one
operation-local conditional request input. The declaration names the relation
column, exact typed literal, operation, target input, encoding capability,
accuracy (`exact` or `superset`), base occurrence domain, and occurrence proof.

The safety law is:

```text
DuckDB predicate D implies remote predicate R
```

Exactness additionally requires `R` to imply `D` over the declared occurrence
bag with matching multiplicity. A label is not proof. Compiler fixtures must
exercise TRUE, FALSE, NULL, duplicates, unknown restricted occurrences,
changed rows, extra rows, and lost true rows.

DuckDB retains every predicate offered to the extension, including an exact
mapped predicate. Projection, ordering, limit, and offset remain DuckDB-owned.
V1 has no author declarations for remote projection, ordering, or limit
pushdown.

## Diagnostics

Compilation produces bounded deterministic diagnostics with an exact code,
phase, safe package-relative source coordinate, and structural field. Source
content, absolute roots, credentials, secret names, generated documents,
request bodies, rows, and remote messages are never diagnostic fields.

The stable codes are:

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `DUCKDB_API_UNSUPPORTED_SPEC` | Missing, draft, or unknown `api_version` |
| `DUCKDB_API_UNSUPPORTED_DIALECT` | Unknown extractor dialect |
| `DUCKDB_API_MALFORMED_YAML` | Encoding, document, duplicate-key, alias/tag, or syntax failure |
| `DUCKDB_API_UNKNOWN_FIELD` | Field outside the closed schema |
| `DUCKDB_API_MISSING_FIELD` | Required field absent |
| `DUCKDB_API_DUPLICATE_ID` | Identifier duplicate or case/path collision |
| `DUCKDB_API_INVALID_REFERENCE` | Missing or wrong-kind reference |
| `DUCKDB_API_INVALID_IDENTIFIER` | Value outside the identifier grammar |
| `DUCKDB_API_INVALID_TYPE` | Unsupported type or typed-value mismatch |
| `DUCKDB_API_INVALID_EXTRACTOR` | Path outside `json_path_v1` |
| `DUCKDB_API_RESERVED_INPUT` | Declared relation input is `secret` |
| `DUCKDB_API_UNSUPPORTED_DECLARATION` | Well-formed value outside v1 |
| `DUCKDB_API_INVALID_SELECTOR` | Selector, fallback, eligibility, or tie invalid |
| `DUCKDB_API_INVALID_PREDICATE` | Mapping, proof, domain, or encoding invalid |
| `DUCKDB_API_INVALID_GRAPHQL_PROFILE` | Structured query cannot produce the closed profile |
| `DUCKDB_API_POLICY_WIDENING` | Network, credential, or resource authority widens |
| `DUCKDB_API_RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` | Compiler or fixture budget exhausted |
| `DUCKDB_API_PACKAGE_IDENTITY` | Source snapshot, digest, or version identity fails |
| `DUCKDB_API_FIXTURE_MISMATCH` | Offline evidence differs from compiled behavior |
| `DUCKDB_API_INCOMPATIBLE_RELOAD` | Candidate transition is not compatible |
| `DUCKDB_API_PUBLICATION_CONFLICT` | Catalog or generation publication refuses atomically |

Diagnostics sort by phase, source path, line, column, field, code, and safe
detail. At most 256 records are retained: the first 255 detail candidates and
one terminal resource record.

## Offline fixtures

`fixtures/index.yaml` is explicit author evidence, not package identity.
Fixture tooling first compiles the same immutable package generation used by
load and derives the typed required coverage entries from that generation
before opening `fixtures/`. It then validates the index against its closed
schema and package digest, requires exact claimed coverage and payload file-set
agreement, verifies every payload digest and retained identity, and only then
executes the first variant.

Fixtures predict operation selection, exact request structure, response pages,
typed rows, predicate occurrence laws, error stage, and safe explanation.
They cannot grant network or credential authority and do not replace the host
policy or Runtime admission checks.

V2 and v3 packages use this same offline fixture contract and coverage
derivation.
Authors provide the ordinary success, duplicate, and terminal-response bags;
the project-owned Runtime suite supplies transient gateway and zero-response
transport failures, retry exhaustion, cancellation, and byte-boundary probes.
The fixture grammar does not let an author manufacture transport facts or
assert that a retry occurred.

For v3, the author transcript remains the same single-attempt base transcript.
Connector derives closed coverage for disabled/fail/wait modes, declared
statuses and guidance formats, optional remaining/bucket roles, and safe
explanation. Project-owned typed variants inject matching responses, paired
wall/steady clocks, queue state, waits, and follow-up attempts. No author field
supplies a clock, scheduler hook, transport failure, or assertion that another
attempt occurred. Derived, claimed, and actually executed coverage keys must
agree exactly.

Each declared `covers` key selects a closed project-owned variant executor in
addition to identifying its compiled scope. The case transcript and expected
value describe the base execution; source mutation, diagnostics, planning
failure, resource boundaries, cancellation, Runtime failure, reload, and
publication variants are generated only by the project runner from the
validated generation and identity-checked transcript. No author field can
supply those mutations or hooks. Acceptance requires the runner's actually
executed key set to equal the index's claimed set exactly; listing a key without
executing its production-path variant leaves it uncovered.

The coverage key is a stable display identity, not a dispatch encoding. The
runner retains the mapping rule, scope, variant, and bound identifiers as
typed derivation facts and never reconstructs them by splitting the key.

For the repository GitHub package, the independently derived contract contains
258 unique coverage keys. The checked-in RFC decision cases are examples; the
delivery gate executes the complete set.

## Reload compatibility

Reload compares normalized compiled descriptors, not source path, YAML order,
comments, or explanation prose.

- Byte-identical digest is an exact no-op.
- A greater PATCH may change provenance only when the normalized descriptor is
  identical.
- A greater MINOR may retain the descriptor or append relations while leaving
  every existing relation structurally identical and ordered.
- Reused versions with another digest, downgrade, non-greater changed source,
  next-major transition, relation removal/reordering/change, and any auth,
  origin, policy, resource, schema, input, operation, predicate, or execution
  change to an existing relation are incompatible. Column order, scalar versus
  array shape, array element type, child nullability, outer nullability, and
  extractor are all schema changes.

Failure publishes nothing and leaves the active generation and every bound or
in-flight owner usable.

| Diagnostics | 256 |
| Fixture cases and response pages per case | 1,024 and 32 |
| Fixture index and one payload | 4 MiB and 8 MiB |
| Aggregate fixture payloads and leaves | 256 MiB and 4,096 |

A host may choose a lower value. The effective limit is the minimum of the
host and specification ceilings; zero never means unlimited.

## Compatibility boundary

`duckdb_api/v1` contains exactly its frozen byte-copied schemas and remains
one-attempt. `duckdb_api/v2` adds only the bounded safe-read retry block above.
`duckdb_api/v3` retains v2 and adds only the bounded reactive rate-limit block
above. None contains author-chosen SQL names, automatic discovery,
URLs as package roots, OpenAPI or GraphQL introspection import, raw GraphQL
documents, dynamic schemas, write operations, connection profiles,
partitions, providers, enrichment, retry of writes or unclassified failures,
caching, proactive successful-response pacing, distributed quota coordination,
remote projection/order/limit declarations, an opaque body-embedded cursor
used directly to build the next request, reverse or bidirectional traversal,
custom native code, WASM, or a public C++ ABI.

Adding any such capability requires a later accepted contract. An
implementation must reject the declaration rather than accept and ignore it.

The REST pagination strategy set is `{disabled, link_next, response_next,
short_page}`: `response_next` (the response-body-URL reconstruct-and-verify
shape) was accepted by [RFC 0016](rfcs/0016-decide-body-signaled-rest-pagination.md)
and shipped in `0.10.0`; `short_page` (count-terminated, no external
continuation signal) was accepted and shipped by
[RFC 0019](rfcs/0019-add-short-page-pagination.md). See the REST pagination
section above for both strategies' full grammar. An opaque body-embedded
cursor used directly to build the next request, and reverse or bidirectional
traversal, remain permanent exclusions of this boundary.
