"""Shared primitives duplicated verbatim across the release-pins identity
verifiers: verify-source-identities.py, verify-native-product-sources.py,
and verify-native-dependencies.py.

Each of those three verifiers checks a distinct identity domain — repository
source/digest identity, CMake's configured build-graph translation-unit
order, and SDK/toolchain/libcurl identity — at different points in the build
pipeline, against different evidence, with different threat models. They stay
three separate scripts for that reason. Only the two primitives below were
byte-for-byte duplicated across them; this module exists to remove that
duplication, not to unify the verifiers themselves.
